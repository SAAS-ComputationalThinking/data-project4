    "* Demonstrate that you can access specific rows, columns, and entries of a data frame\n",
    "* Demonstrate that you can iterate through a list (a particular row or column, or a set of rows or columns)\n",
    "* Demonstrate filtering pattern using if-then-else\n",
    "* Demonstrate that you can reconstruct an accumulator pattern\n",
    "* Write a function to make use of the same block of code over and over again.\n",
    "* Understand how indentation is used in python to indicate logical and functional blocks (and compare to how this is done in other languages)\n"

There is more missing data, so we will have to handle it differently this time, but you will be doing the same kinds of things with this data, and the goal is to be sure everyone is clear on how accessing the data works and how to use it."
